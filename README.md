# FAQ

## Does this work on bedrock edition?

I have tested reworking this for bedrock edition (Nethergames) and haven't got it to 
really work it was pretty slow but i'll work on it soon.

## I don't want to run it on my computer

Well I see your aprehensiveness of running random code on your computer which is good
so I've made a replit that you can use in the cloud so you aren't running it yourself.

## How do I get an api key?

Login to [developers.hypixel.net](https://developer.hypixel.net/dashboard) with your forums account, and copy the dev key (it will expire in 24 hours), or you can just make an app with some bs title and description and then that wont expire.
